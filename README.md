**👋 Hi there, I’m Ashutosh**

🔧 A passionate Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) with expertise in designing, deploying, and maintaining highly available, scalable, and resilient systems across cloud, containerized, and distributed environments.

**👨‍💻 About Me**

I specialize in cloud infrastructure, automation, and observability, ensuring systems run efficiently and reliably. I have hands-on experience with AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, EKS, IAM, CloudFormation, CloudWatch, X-Ray, Secrets Manager), GCP, Azure, and infrastructure automation tools like Terraform and Ansible. I design resilient, high-availability architectures using Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, and implement auto-healing, load balancing, and secrets management to maintain system stability.

I also focus on CI/CD pipelines and automation using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Python, and Bash, ensuring smooth, repeatable deployments. My monitoring and observability expertise includes Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Splunk, ELK, and AWS CloudWatch/X-Ray, paired with SLOs/SLIs/SLAs, error budgets, incident management (PagerDuty, ServiceNow), postmortems, and root cause analysis to drive continuous reliability improvements.

**🚀 What I Do**

Build, maintain, and scale cloud-native systems with high availability, auto-scaling, and performance tuning.

Design and implement microservices architectures, distributed systems, and messaging pipelines using Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pub/Sub, with caching strategies for optimal performance.

Automate deployments and infrastructure using CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, Ansible, and scripting (Python, Bash).

Monitor and troubleshoot production systems with Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, ELK Stack, ensuring proactive incident management and reliability improvements.

Ensure secure, compliant, and auditable systems with robust configuration management, logging, and secret handling.

Optimize database and storage performance across PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

**🤝 Open to Collaborate**

I’m eager to contribute to projects involving:

Cloud infrastructure and container orchestration (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, OpenShift)

Automation, CI/CD, and deployment pipelines

Observability, monitoring, SLOs, incident response, and postmortem analysis

System reliability, performance optimization, and scalable architecture

**😄 Pronouns: He/Him**

⚡ Fun Fact: I enjoy automating repetitive tasks, exploring new cloud technologies, and occasionally jamming on the guitar after a day of debugging production issues.
